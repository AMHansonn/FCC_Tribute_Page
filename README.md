# FCC_Tribute_Page
This is one another one of my projects for my freeCodeCamp New Responsive Web Design certification. It is a tribute page for one of my best friends, Emmy.

This was all made in good fun for her.

Support her! <3

*As noted on the page, this is a joke page, noting some fun/notable things that have happened in my best friend's life. None of this was recent, as I made a point to end it after December 2020. I could've made this much longer, but it could've been dangerous for her and I.*
